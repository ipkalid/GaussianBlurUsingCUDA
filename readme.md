# Introduction
Welcome to the GaussianBlurUsingCUDA project! This project focuses on implementing Gaussian Blur on images using CUDA for high-performance image processing. By leveraging the power of GPU computing, we aim to achieve faster processing times compared to CPU-based solutions.

# Requirements
The project has different requirements for Python and C++ environments. Ensure you meet all the prerequisites before proceeding.

For Python Environment
Install Python:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend Python 3.7 or newer.
You can download Python from python.org.
Install CUDA Toolkit:

Download and install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.
CUDA Toolkit is essential for GPU-accelerated applications.
Visit NVIDIA's website to download the CUDA Toolkit.
For C++ Environment
Install Visual Studio:

Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio.
Make sure to include C++ development components during installation.
Visual Studio can be downloaded from the official site.
Install CUDA Toolkit:

Follow the same steps as in the Python environment to install the CUDA Toolkit.
Install OpenCV:

OpenCV is used for image processing tasks.
You can install OpenCV via pre-built binaries or build it from source.
Visit OpenCV's official site for download and installation instructions.
Setup and Installation
After installing the prerequisites, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GaussianBlurUsingCUDA.git
Follow the instructions in the INSTALL.md file for detailed setup and installation steps for both Python and C++ environments.

Usage
Refer to the USAGE.md file for instructions on how to use the application in both Python and C++ environments.
